# University projects
Projects made during my studies to practise programming in Python

## Bioinformatics Algorithms
Ideas for projects are taken from book 'Bioinformatics Algorithms: Design and Implementation in Python' by Miguel Rocha & Pedro G. Ferreira

### Project 1
Writing a set of functions working over matrices (represented as a list of lists)

### Project 2
Writing a function that using regular expressions parses a string and returns a dictionary with the different fields

### Project 3
Considering the functions to calculate pairwise global alignments
