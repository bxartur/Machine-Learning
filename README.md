# University projects
A part of projects made during my studies to practise programming in Python


## Bioinformatics Algorithms
Main target - learning about algorithms used in computer science with special focus on bioinformatic ones.
Ideas for projects are taken from book 'Bioinformatics Algorithms: Design and Implementation in Python' by Miguel Rocha & Pedro G. Ferreira.

  ### Project 1
  Writing a set of functions working over matrices (represented as a list of lists)

  ### Project 2
  Writing a function that using regular expressions parses a string and returns a dictionary with the different fields

  ### Project 3
  Considering the functions to calculate pairwise global alignments


## Machine Learning
Learning about machine learning and using it in practise.
Database about red wines from Spain used in following projects is donwloaded from 'kaggle.com'.

### Project 1
Making analysis of data, preparing data and testing regression algorithms to predict data in column 'price'

### Project 2
Making analysis of data, preparing data and testing classification algorithms to assign elements of database to adequate classes
